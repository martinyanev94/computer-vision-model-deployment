# Final Project: Building and Deploying a Computer Vision Model

## Project Overview

In this project, students will apply the concepts learned throughout the course on computer vision and deep learning. The goal is to create a web service that allows users to upload images and receive predictions from a trained deep learning model. This encompasses model training, API development, and deployment in the cloud.

## Project Objectives

1. **Train a Computer Vision Model**
   - Choose a dataset (e.g., Surface-Defect Dataset, Image Classification dataset).
   - Preprocess the data and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch.
   - Train the model and evaluate its performance.

2. **Set Up a Web API**
   - Utilize FastAPI to create a web service.
   - Implement endpoints to accept image uploads and return predictions.
   - Add necessary validation and error handling.

3. **Containerize the Application**
   - Use Docker to containerize the application, ensuring all dependencies are included.

4. **Deploy to Cloud**
   - Deploy the Docker container to a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
   - Ensure the API is accessible over the internet.

5. **Documentation**
   - Write detailed documentation covering installation, usage, and deployment steps.
   - Include clear instructions and code snippets for replicating your setup.

## Deliverables

- A GitHub repository containing:
  - Source code for the trained model and API.
  - Dockerfile and instructions for building the container.
  - Clear README file explaining the setup and usage.
- A presentation summarizing the project, challenges faced, and outcomes.

## Steps to Complete the Project

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Select and download the dataset relevant to the chosen computer vision task.
   - Implement data loading and preprocessing in PyTorch.

2. **Model Development**
   - Build and train the CNN model using PyTorch.
   - Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve performance.
   
3. **API Development**
   - Set up FastAPI with endpoints for model prediction.
   - Implement image upload functionality, prediction logic, and response formatting.

4. **Containerization**
   - Create a Docker image that encapsulates the application.
   - Test the image locally to ensure functionality.

5. **Cloud Deployment**
   - Choose a cloud provider and follow their guidelines to deploy the application.
   - Test the deployed API to ensure it is operational.

6. **Documentation and Presentation**
   - Prepare documentation and a demonstration of the project.
   - Conclude with a reflection on what was learned and possible future improvements.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit the GitHub repository link along with a short demonstration video or presentation on the project.
- Ensure the repository is well-organized, with a focus on clarity and ease of use for others who may follow your work.
